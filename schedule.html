					<h2>The Attendance Tracker</h2>
					In order to help the people get back to school, we have to figure out who's struggling and why they're doing it. 
					Our solution is based on a machine that can count the amount of days a student attends to school. 
					This machine can track every single student in a class of 30 for a whole month, and it can 
					individually show which days the students are attending their classes or not. With this machine, 
					we can now track the attendance of all the students and see who's falling out of school. From there, 
					we can take actions by reaching out to the ones who's struggling, and try to solve their problems together.

					<h2>How does it really work?</h2>
					How this machine counts the attendances, is shown by how it collects a single ball for 
					each day when a button is pressed. Every single student gets a button and a individual 
					"ball room" to differ from other students, while the teacher presses 
					the buttons to register for the students' attendance. When the buttons are pressed, 
					a single ball from the main ball room then opens up and falls through.

					<h2>From School to the Government</h2>
					After every month the teachers takes out all the individual rooms, and notes down the number of
					days which the students weren't attending. These notes will be sent to the government to be
					translated into digital information by an an optical reader. The digital information will then be 
					used for statistics so that the government can plan out their actions to help the ones falling off from school.
